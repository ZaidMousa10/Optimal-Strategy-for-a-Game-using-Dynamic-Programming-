# Optimal Strategy for a Game using Dynamic Programming

**Problem Description** 

This is a two-player game. There are even number of coins arranged in a row. There will be 
alternate turns. In each turn, a player can either select the first coin in the row or the last coin in 
the row and keep it with him. The objective of the problem is to determine the maximum 
possible amount of money a player can definitely win, if he moves first.  

**Problem Solution**

In this problem, we will try to collect maximum amount without underestimating the opponent. 
We can choose either the first or the last coin in the row. We will pick the one which results in 
giving us lesser amount to ensure that we can definitely win this much of amount irrespective 
of opponentâ€™s moves.
